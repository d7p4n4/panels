# panels
If you click one of th four buttons, the panel which belongs to that button, will appear. Each button means a band name of my favourites, and the panel, that will be shown, contains five songs of them, and a cd cover. These will be bigger if your coursor is on them. This webpage has a breakpoint, so you can load it in on your phone, and it will be also positioned well. (pics and background have a relative path. They are stored in "assets" folder.)
